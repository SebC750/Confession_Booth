# Confession Board App

## Overview
A simple anonymous confession board built with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Firestore.

Users can submit confessions and view existing ones through a clean, minimal interface.
The app is built using Next.js App Router with API Routes for backend logic, connecting securely to a Firestore database.

This project was created to practice full-stack development with Next.js, serverless API routes, and Firebase Firestore, focusing on clean architecture, scalability, and modern deployment-ready standards. This was also meant to be a fun hobby project to have others interact with and share their darkest secrets in peace.
